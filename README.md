Project Title:

Simple Sports Trivia Game

Project Description:

This project represents a simple Python application producing a sports trivia quiz with pre-set
questions. The project takes advantage of a basic, locally hosted sqlite database. Using Python
as the programming language of choice allowed for a straightforward implementation of the program.

Two files exist: a main file entitled main.py and a database-handling file called database.py. 

To run the program, one can use pyinstaller to create an executable file in Windows(the only OS 
used so far). If no executable file is created, the program can run in an IDE of choice using
the pertaing console.
